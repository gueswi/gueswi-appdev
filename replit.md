# Recent Changes

## Pipeline CRM System (October 2025)
Implemented complete Pipeline CRM with Kanban-style visual workflow accessible at `/pipeline`:

### Backend Implementation
- **13 Protected API Endpoints** - All requiring authentication with tenant isolation:
  - Stages: GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE `/api/pipeline/stages` + POST `/api/pipeline/stages/reorder`
  - Leads: GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE `/api/pipeline/leads` + GET `/api/pipeline/leads/:id`
  - Actions: PATCH `/api/pipeline/leads/:id/move` + POST `/api/pipeline/leads/:id/activities`
  - Metrics: GET `/api/pipeline/metrics` (real-time calculations)
- **Database Schema**:
  - `pipeline_stages`: id (uuid), tenant_id, name, order, color, is_fixed, created_at
  - `leads`: id (uuid), tenant_id, stage_id, name, email, phone, company, value, currency, probability, source, assigned_to, expected_close_date, closed_at, notes, tags, created_at, updated_at
  - `lead_activities`: id (uuid), lead_id, user_id, type (note/call/email/meeting/stage_change), description, metadata, created_at
- **Metrics Calculation**:
  - Total Pipeline Value: Sum of all lead values
  - Conversion Rate: (Won leads / Total leads) Ã— 100
  - Average Closing Days: Time from creation to won status
  - Won/Total Counts: Real-time deal tracking
- **Fixed Stages**: "Ganado" and "Perdido" stages auto-seeded, protected from deletion/editing

### Frontend Implementation
- **Main Page**: `client/src/pages/pipeline-page.tsx`
  - Kanban board with horizontal stage columns
  - Metrics header with 5 key metrics (Total Value, Conversion Rate, Won Count, Total Count, Avg Days)
  - Search/filter functionality
  - @dnd-kit integration for drag-and-drop
- **5 Core Components**:
  - `StageColumn`: Droppable container for leads with stage info
  - `LeadCard`: Draggable lead card with value, company, probability, tags
  - `NewLeadDialog`: Comprehensive form (name, company, email, phone, value, currency, probability, stage, close date, notes, tags)
  - `StagesEditorDialog`: Stage management with drag-to-reorder, create/edit/delete, color picker
  - `LeadDetailsDialog`: 3-tab interface (Info, Activities timeline, Edit)
- **Drag-and-Drop Features**:
  - Drag leads between stages (auto-creates stage_change activity)
  - Drag stages to reorder (updates order for all stages)
  - Visual feedback during drag operations
- **Quick Actions**:
  - "Mark as Won" - Moves lead to Ganado stage, sets closed_at
  - "Mark as Lost" - Moves lead to Perdido stage, sets closed_at
- **Activities Tracking**:
  - Automatic activities: lead created, lead updated, stage changed
  - Manual activities: notes, calls, emails, meetings
  - Timeline view with timestamps

### UX Features
- Loading states for all queries and mutations
- Toast notifications for all actions (success/error)
- Responsive design for mobile/tablet/desktop
- Dark mode support throughout
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- Search by lead name or company
- data-testid attributes for all interactive elements

- Default stages: Lead (#3b82f6), Qualified (#8b5cf6), Proposal (#f59e0b), Ganado (#10b981, fixed), Perdido (#ef4444, fixed)

## Advanced Metrics Dashboard (October 2025)
Implemented production-ready advanced analytics dashboard accessible at `/analytics`:

### Backend Implementation
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/metrics/dashboard` - Protected route requiring authentication
- **Real-time Calculations**:
  - ROI Savings: Calculated from AI-processed calls vs human cost ($15/hour baseline)
  - Hours Saved: Derived from call duration and AI automation rates
  - CSAT Score: Averaged from AI success rates in aiMetrics table
  - CSAT Change: Period-over-period comparison (last 30 days vs previous 30 days)
  - Churn Risk: Calculated from negative sentiment percentage
  - Intent Detection: Keyword-based analysis of conversation transcripts
  - Sentiment Analysis: Positive/neutral/negative distribution from conversations
  - Optimization Opportunities: Automated detection based on queue wait times and AI usage

### Data Sources
- `callRecords` table: AI-processed calls, durations, timestamps
- `aiMetrics` table: Success rates, AI performance data
- `conversations` table: Transcripts for intent and sentiment analysis
- `queues` table: Average wait times for opportunity detection

### Key Features
- **Production-ready**: All metrics calculated from real database queries
- **Proper fallbacks**: Only uses default values when no data exists (e.g., new tenants)
- **Time period isolation**: Non-overlapping boundaries for accurate period comparisons
- **Consistent calculations**: CSAT display and change values use same underlying data
- **NaN handling**: Proper null/undefined checks throughout

### Frontend Component
- Location: `client/src/pages/metrics-dashboard.tsx`
- Route: `/analytics` in App.tsx
- Features: Loading states, metric cards with trend indicators, sentiment charts, intentions breakdown, opportunities list
- Styling: Consistent with Gueswi design system using Tailwind CSS

## Pipeline CRM Bug Fixes and Enhancements (October 2025)
Resolved 4 critical bugs and implemented enhanced drag & drop UX for Pipeline CRM:

### Fix #1: Stage Reorder Endpoint (500 Error Resolution)
- **Problem**: PATCH `/api/pipeline/stages/reorder` returning 500 errors
- **Root Cause**: Express route order - specific `/reorder` route placed after parametric `/:id` route
- **Solution**: Moved `/api/pipeline/stages/reorder` BEFORE `/api/pipeline/stages/:id` in server/routes.ts
- **Result**: Stage reordering works without errors

### Fix #2: Text Truncation in Stage Editor
- **Problem**: Stage names truncating while typing due to aggressive debouncing
- **Root Cause**: 800ms debounce causing API calls mid-typing
- **Solution**: Increased debounce to 1500ms and added temp ID validation in `StagesEditorDialog`
- **Result**: Users can type long stage names without text cutting off

### Fix #3: Drag Activation Refinement
- **Problem**: Drag activating too easily (3px), causing accidental drags
- **Solution**: Changed sensor config to `distance: 8` for more deliberate activation
- **Result**: Smoother, more intentional drag operations

### Fix #4: Lead Details Data Persistence
- **Problem**: Lead details showing "N/A" after editing and saving
- **Root Cause**: TanStack Query queryKey using array format `["/api/pipeline/leads", id]` which concatenated incorrectly as `/api/pipeline/leads?${id}`
- **Solution**: Changed all queryKeys to use complete URL strings: `['/api/pipeline/leads/${id}']`
- **Result**: Lead details properly refetch and display updated data after edits

### FIX FINAL: Enhanced Drag & Drop UX
Implemented production-ready drag & drop with custom collision detection and improved visual feedback:

#### Drag & Drop Architecture Changes
- **LeadCard**: Changed from `useSortable` to `useDraggable` (only draggable, not droppable)
- **StageColumn**: Removed `SortableContext`, uses only `useDroppable`
- **Result**: Prevents overId from incorrectly detecting other leads instead of stages

#### Custom Collision Detection Chain
```javascript
customCollision = (args) => {
  const pointerCollisions = pointerWithin(args);     // Priority 1: Pointer inside drop zone
  if (pointerCollisions.length > 0) return pointerCollisions;
  
  const intersections = rectIntersection(args);       // Priority 2: Rectangle overlap
  if (intersections.length > 0) return intersections;
  
  return closestCorners(args);                        // Priority 3: Fallback to closest
};
```

#### Visual Enhancements
- **Drop Zone Size**: Increased from min-h-[400px] to min-h-[500px] for larger target area
- **Visual Feedback**: ring-4 (up from ring-2) for clearer highlighting
- **Hover Effect**: scale-[1.02] subtle zoom when dragging over column
- **Transitions**: transition-all duration-200 for smooth animations
- **Drag Activation**: 8px distance (reduced from 10px) for balanced feel

#### Files Modified
- `client/src/pages/pipeline-page.tsx`: Custom collision detection, drag handlers
- `client/src/components/pipeline/lead-card.tsx`: useDraggable implementation
- `client/src/components/pipeline/stage-column.tsx`: Simplified droppable, enhanced visuals
- `client/src/components/pipeline/lead-details-dialog.tsx`: Fixed queryKeys
- `server/routes.ts`: Fixed route ordering for /reorder endpoint
- `client/src/components/pipeline/stages-editor-dialog.tsx`: Debounce and validation

#### Testing
All fixes verified with end-to-end Playwright testing:
- Stage reordering without 500 errors âœ“
- Long text entry without truncation âœ“
- Smooth drag activation and visual feedback âœ“
- Lead data persistence after editing âœ“
- Drag & drop with correct collision detection âœ“
- Toast notifications on successful operations âœ“

The application follows a clean architecture pattern with proper separation of concerns, type safety throughout the stack, and scalable patterns for multi-tenant SaaS operations.
